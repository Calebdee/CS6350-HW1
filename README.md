# This is a machine learning library developed by Caleb Johnson for CS5350/6350 in University of Utah

# To run the decision tree algorithm, you can use the run.sh script in the DecisionTree directory. The decision tree class has the follows methods to be used. 

# fit(X, y), takes training data and labels and computes information at each level to split the decision tree properly.

# score(X, y), takes in data and computes the accuracy score.

# predict(X), leveraged by score, but also takes data and predicts the label
